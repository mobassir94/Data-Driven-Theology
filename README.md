# Solution / Pipeline

1. from [bibleverses](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/phyred23/bibleverses) dataset we first separate old testament

2. for each verse in old testament we compare similarity of each and every verse of the Holy Quran.

3. for [Finding Similar Verses between Quran and Torah](https://github.com/mobassir94/Data-Driven-Theology/tree/main/Quran%20vs%20Bible) we used popular [SentenceTransformers](https://www.sbert.net/) models and they are all-MiniLM-L6-v2,msmarco-distilbert-base-tas-b,all-mpnet-base-v2,all-MiniLM-L12-v2 and google's [Universal Sentence Encoder Large](https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder-large/5) model. (NOTE : we used different data processing with all-MiniLM-L12-v2 model).

4. ENSEMBLE : we pick the verses pairs from each dataframe (output of each model discussed in step 3) with highest confident score (we take the decision based on histogram score distribution), then we merge all the filtered dataset and drop duplicates except first. then we sort the final filtered dataset and save that dataset for next level research. check the ensemble notebook called [find similar verses between quran and bible](https://github.com/mobassir94/Data-Driven-Theology/blob/main/Quran%20vs%20Bible/find-similar-verses-between-quran-and-bible.ipynb)  for better understanding.
